The "Windows Terminal Profile Creator" script is a PowerShell script that automates the process of creating a new profile in Windows Terminal with a custom binary. This script can be used to achieve persistence by adding a customized profile that runs a specific binary or command upon opening Windows Terminal.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- Windows operating system with Windows Terminal installed.
- PowerShell version 5.1 or later.

Please note that the script creates a new profile in Windows Terminal's JSON configuration file. The profile will appear in the Windows Terminal application once the script is executed successfully.

## Configuration

In the script, you can customize the profile properties by modifying the values in the `$newProfile` hashtable. The following properties are available:

- `name`: Specify the desired name for the new profile.
- `commandline`: Define the binary or command to be executed for the profile. Modify this property to point to your desired binary or command.
- `hidden`: Set this property to `$true` if you want the profile to be hidden in Windows Terminal.
- `guid2`: The script generates a new GUID for the profile automatically. You can modify this property if you want to specify a specific GUID.

Make sure to customize these properties according to your requirements before running the script.
